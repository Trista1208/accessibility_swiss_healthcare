   - 2 websites failed the "Skip links are not focusable" criterion
   - Most keyboard focus tests were not conducted, representing a significant blind spot

## METHODOLOGY

- Analysis based on Google Lighthouse audits of 92 Swiss healthcare websites
- 7 websites were excluded (PDFs and non-HTML content) that couldn't be properly analyzed
- Excluded domains: cds.cern.ch, smw.ch, cioms.ch, www.lausanneuniversityhospital.com, news.microsoft.com, www.samw.ch, and www.dignitas.ch
- Analysis focused on four key metrics: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO
- Data processed through automated scripts with appropriate handling of missing data

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Prioritize Critical Issues**:
   - Fix performance issues like Time to Interactive and First Contentful Paint
   - Implement efficient caching policies for static assets
   - Add explicit image dimensions to improve layout stability
   - Optimize JavaScript loading and execution
   - Reduce unused CSS/JavaScript

2. **Implement Accessibility Standards**:
   - Adopt and adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Establish accessibility testing in the development lifecycle
   - Create consistent accessibility patterns across websites
   - Provide comprehensive accessibility training for development teams

3. **Expand Keyboard Accessibility Testing**: 
   - Significantly increase testing coverage for keyboard focus
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Test focus management and visibility for all UI components
   - Implement proper skip links for keyboard navigation

4. **Establish Regular Testing & Monitoring**:
   - Implement regular automated and manual accessibility audits
   - Set benchmarks for improvement over time
   - Include user testing with people with disabilities
   - Develop a prioritized remediation plan for critical issues

## IMPACT OF ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Broader Reach**: Approximately 1 in 5 people have some form of disability. Accessible websites ensure healthcare information reaches all potential patients.

2. **Legal Compliance**: Many jurisdictions require websites to meet accessibility standards, reducing legal risk.

3. **Better User Experience**: Accessibility improvements benefit all users, not just those with disabilities.

4. **Improved SEO**: Many accessibility practices also improve search engine rankings.

5. **Ethical Responsibility**: Healthcare providers have a particular obligation to ensure equal access to health information.

## CONCLUSION

The accessibility of Swiss healthcare websites requires significant improvement. With less than half meeting basic accessibility standards, there is a clear need for healthcare providers to address these issues. Improving accessibility ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, have equal access to vital healthcare information and services.

## NEXT STEPS

1. Share these findings with healthcare website stakeholders
2. Develop a prioritized remediation plan focusing on the most critical issues
3. Establish accessibility guidelines for future development
4. Implement regular monitoring to track improvements
5. Conduct more in-depth testing of the lowest-performing domains
6. Initiate comprehensive keyboard accessibility testing across all websites
