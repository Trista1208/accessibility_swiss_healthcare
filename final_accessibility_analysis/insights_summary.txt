# HEALTHCARE WEBSITE ACCESSIBILITY ANALYSIS INSIGHTS
=======================================================

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis evaluated the accessibility of 99 healthcare websites in Switzerland using Lighthouse metrics. 
Overall, Swiss healthcare websites show moderate accessibility compliance, with significant room for improvement.

## KEY FINDINGS

1. Only 45.5% of analyzed healthcare websites pass accessibility standards (score â‰¥90)
2. The average accessibility score is 88.1/100
3. Websites have an average of 9.6 accessibility issues per site
4. There is a 41.0-point difference between the best and worst performing domains
5. Only 7.1% of sites have no detected accessibility issues
6. Performance metrics are also problematic, with only 6.1% of sites passing performance standards
7. Best Practices (58.6% pass) and SEO (57.6% pass) have better compliance rates

## MOST COMMON ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES

1. Time to Interactive (86 instances)
2. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy (86 instances)
3. Speed Index (85 instances)
4. First Contentful Paint (81 instances)
5. Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers (62 instances)
6. Image elements do not have explicit `width` and `height` (61 instances)
7. Max Potential First Input Delay (54 instances)
8. Improve image delivery (50 instances)
9. Largest Contentful Paint (44 instances)
10. Ensure text remains visible during webfont load (43 instances)

## DOMAIN ANALYSIS

The analysis revealed significant variations in accessibility scores across domains, with the lowest-scoring domains being:
- www.lucernehealth.com: 59.0
- boris.unibe.ch: 65.0
- www.chuv.ch: 70.0
- www.pwc.ch: 71.0
- www.clinic-badragaz.ch: 75.0

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Prioritize Critical Issues**: Focus on fixing the most common accessibility issues identified in this analysis, particularly those that affect core functionality (Time to Interactive, First Contentful Paint).

2. **Implement Regular Audits**: Establish regular accessibility testing as part of the development and maintenance process. Automated tools combined with manual testing provide the most comprehensive approach.

3. **Adopt WCAG Standards**: Focus on meeting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards, which are recognized internationally as the benchmark for web accessibility.

4. **Training**: Provide accessibility training for web development, design, and content teams to ensure awareness of accessibility requirements during the creation process rather than retrofitting later.

5. **User Testing**: Conduct testing with real users who have disabilities to identify practical accessibility barriers that automated tools might miss.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Improve Time to Interactive and First Contentful Paint metrics by optimizing JavaScript loading, reducing server response times, and implementing efficient caching policies.

7. **Image Optimization**: Ensure all images have explicit width and height attributes to reduce layout shifts and improve user experience.

8. **Standardize Implementation**: Develop accessibility standards and patterns for common website elements to ensure consistency across the website.

## IMPACT OF ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS

Improving website accessibility in the healthcare sector has significant benefits:

1. **Broader Reach**: Approximately 1 in 5 people have some form of disability. Accessible websites ensure healthcare information reaches all potential patients.

2. **Legal Compliance**: Many jurisdictions require websites to meet certain accessibility standards, reducing legal risk.

3. **Better User Experience**: Accessibility improvements benefit all users, not just those with disabilities.

4. **Improved SEO**: Many accessibility practices also improve search engine rankings.

5. **Ethical Responsibility**: Healthcare providers have a particular obligation to ensure equal access to health information.

## NEXT STEPS

1. Share these findings with stakeholders and website owners
2. Develop a prioritized remediation plan focusing on the most critical issues
3. Establish accessibility guidelines for future development
4. Implement regular monitoring to track improvements
5. Conduct more in-depth testing of the lowest-performing domains

## METHODOLOGY

This analysis was conducted using Google Lighthouse accessibility audits on healthcare websites in Switzerland. 
Data was collected and processed through automated scripts, with missing or invalid data appropriately handled. 
The analysis focused on four key metrics: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.

## VISUALIZATIONS

The following visualizations were generated as part of this analysis:

1. **Accessibility Dashboard**: Comprehensive overview of key metrics
2. **Score Distributions**: Distribution of Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO scores
3. **Common Issues**: The most frequently encountered accessibility issues
4. **Pass/Fail Distribution**: Proportion of websites passing accessibility standards
5. **Accessibility vs. Issues**: Relationship between accessibility scores and number of issues
