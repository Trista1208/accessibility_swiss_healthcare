   - This represents a significant blind spot in accessibility testing

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Prioritize Critical Issues**: Focus on fixing the most common accessibility issues, particularly those affecting core functionality (Time to Interactive, First Contentful Paint).

2. **Implement Regular Audits**: Establish regular accessibility testing using both automated tools and manual testing.

3. **Adopt WCAG Standards**: Meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards, the international benchmark for web accessibility.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Improve load times by:
   - Optimizing JavaScript loading and execution
   - Implementing efficient caching policies
   - Setting explicit image dimensions
   - Reducing unused code (CSS/JavaScript)
   - Optimizing responsive image delivery

5. **Expand Keyboard Accessibility Testing**: 
   - Significantly increase testing coverage for keyboard focus accessibility
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Test focus management and visibility for all user interfaces
   - Verify skip links are properly implemented for keyboard users

6. **Training & Standards**: Provide accessibility training for development teams and establish consistent accessibility patterns across websites.

## IMPACT OF ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Broader Reach**: Approximately 1 in 5 people have some form of disability. Accessible websites ensure healthcare information reaches all potential patients.

2. **Legal Compliance**: Many jurisdictions require websites to meet accessibility standards, reducing legal risk.

3. **Better User Experience**: Accessibility improvements benefit all users, not just those with disabilities.

4. **Improved SEO**: Many accessibility practices also improve search engine rankings.

5. **Ethical Responsibility**: Healthcare providers have a particular obligation to ensure equal access to health information.

## NEXT STEPS

1. Share these findings with stakeholders and website owners
2. Develop a prioritized remediation plan focusing on the most critical issues
3. Establish accessibility guidelines for future development
4. Implement regular monitoring to track improvements
5. Conduct more in-depth testing of the lowest-performing domains
6. Initiate comprehensive keyboard accessibility testing for all websites
