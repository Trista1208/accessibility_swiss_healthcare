# Swiss Healthcare Website Accessibility Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the accessibility of Swiss healthcare websites based on Google Lighthouse audits.

## Project Overview

The analysis evaluates the accessibility compliance of 99 healthcare websites in Switzerland, focusing on key metrics including:
- Accessibility scores
- Performance metrics
- Best practices
- SEO standards
- Common accessibility issues

## Repository Structure

- **Data Files**:
  - `lighthouse_results_original.csv`: Raw data from Lighthouse audits
  - `lighthouse_scores_extracted.xlsx`: Extracted scores from the raw data
  - `lighthouse_scores_optimized.xlsx`: Cleaned and optimized data for analysis
  - `lighthouse_scores_summary.xlsx`: Summary of key metrics

- **Code**:
  - `data_collection.py`: Script for collecting the Lighthouse data
  - `clean_lighthouse_data.py`: Script for cleaning and optimizing the data
  - `analytics_and_eda.py`: Script for generating insights and visualizations

- **Results**:
  - `final_insight.txt`: Comprehensive report with key findings and recommendations
  - `final_accessibility_analysis/`: Directory containing all visualizations and insights

## Key Findings

- Only 45.5% of analyzed healthcare websites pass accessibility standards (score â‰¥90)
- The average accessibility score is 88.1/100
- Websites have an average of 9.6 accessibility issues per site
- There is a 41.0-point difference between the best and worst performing domains
- Only 7.1% of sites have no detected accessibility issues
- Performance metrics are particularly problematic, with only 6.1% of sites passing standards

## Visualizations

The analysis includes several visualizations:
- Accessibility score distributions
- Pass/fail breakdown
- Common accessibility issues
- Score correlations
- Issue distributions
- Comprehensive accessibility dashboard

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, key recommendations include:
1. Prioritizing critical accessibility issues
2. Implementing regular accessibility audits
3. Adopting WCAG 2.1 AA standards
4. Providing accessibility training for development teams
5. Optimizing performance through better JavaScript loading and caching policies
